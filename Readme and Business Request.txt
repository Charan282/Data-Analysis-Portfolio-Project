Readme:
"This project visualizes internet sales data using Power BI dashboards, SQL queries for data processing, and a structured data model to enhance business decision-making."

Business Request:
We need to improve internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards. We want to focus on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time. Seeing as each sales person work on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also. We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spread sheet so we can compare our values against performance, The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
